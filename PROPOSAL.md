For my final project I am going to make the game flappy bird_ using cinder. In this game, there are pipes and different
types of obstacles and a bird_ has to navigate through. Everytime a user clicks on the screen the bird_ flaps and stays
afloat. In order to keep the bird_
flying the user has to continuously tap. I will make the game my own by having different themes and playing sounds.

The background knowledge of this kind of project comes from the past assignments we have had using Cinder. In ideal gas
I learned how to set up rectangles on the screen, create a ball which moves with a velocity, and deal with collisions,
all of which will help me in creating flappy bird_. The key down features will help me program the space the bar to keep
the bird_ flying. I want to do this project because I loved playing flappy bird_ growing up. I think it would be cool to
make my own version.

By the end of week one, I will have added structures to the game screen for the background. I will also implement the
base controls like start game and exit using a GUI. By week 2, I will implement the bird_(player object)
which flies due to the space bar being clicked on. Also I will add the obstacles to the screen. By week 3, I will add a
pause control so the game can be paused. I will also add a score board which keeps track how many obstacles the bird_
makes it through. When the player loses, the screen will display the score and allow the user to replay.

If I were to finish the project early, some "stretch goals" I could implement are making the obstacles move so it is
harder for the bird_ to make it through and add power ups for the bird_.
