For my final project I am going to make the game atari break out using cinder.
In this game, there are blocks on the top of the screen and a ball which bounces against 
a board which the user can move across the bottom of the screen. The ball moves on its own and when
it hits a block, the block disappears. The objective of the game is to clear all of the blocks by making
sure the ball keeps moving around without hitting the ground, where the board is not. The user has to move
the board with the keys and make sure the ball does not hit the floor.

The background knowledge of this kind of project comes from the past assignments we have had 
using Cinder. In ideal gas I learned how to set up rectangles on the screen, create a ball which 
moves with a velocity, and deal with collisions, all of which will help me in 
creating Atari breakout. I want to do this project because I love playing Atari breakout
and have a lot fun with it. I think it would be cool to make my own version.

By the end of week one, I will have added structures to the game screen like the blocks, the moving
ball, and the board at the bottom of the screen. By week 2, I will have implemented a method which 
allows the user to move the board across the bottom of the screen with
the arrow keys. By the end of week 3, I will have implemented the collision methods and made sure
that any block touched by the ball disappears. I will also make sure the ball goes upward after colliding
with the board at the bottom. If the ball misses the board, I will end the game for the player
and give a final score.

If I were to finish the project early, some "stretch goals" I could implement are making 
the blocks move around the screen, add more than one ball, or create blocks that need to be
hit by the ball multiple times in order to disappear.
